# iOS Calculator (Version 1.0)

__Hello Devs ðŸ˜€.__

Welcome to the iOS Calculator project! This project is an assignment completed as part of the Frontend Masters web development course. Below, you'll find information about the slight enhancements I made to the project's features and a link to the course's live project.

## Extra Features

- **Auto-resize Fonts on Display:** The calculator display fonts are dynamically resized to enhance the user experience across different screen sizes.

- **Continuity Enabled:** The result is set as the first value, allowing users to seamlessly implement calculations on their results. This feature enhances the calculator's usability and flow.

## Live Project

You can experience the live project on Frontend Masters [here](https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/lessons/putting-it-all-together/project).

I will still be looking into how I can improve the calculator functionality later in the future, like adding decimal rounding, calculation history (something I always wished the Apple iOS Calculator had), and a better overall user interface. __Until Version 2.0 ðŸš€__
